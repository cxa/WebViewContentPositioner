# WebViewContentPositioner

`WebViewContentPositioner` is a scroll position maintainer for `UIWebView`. Never losing scroll position when view resizing on device rotation, split window changing, etc., even if view restoration.

## How to Use

1. Add the `WebViewContentPositioner` repository as a submodule of your application‚Äôs repository.
2. Drag and drop `WebViewContentPositioner.xcodeproj` into your application‚Äôs Xcode project or workspace.
3. On the ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù tab of your application target‚Äôs settings, add `WebViewContentPositioner.framework` to the ‚ÄúEmbedded Binaries‚Äù section.

Or, If you would prefer to use Carthage or CocoaPods, please pull request.

`WebViewContentPositioner` tracks scroll position automatically for device rotation and split window size changing (by swizzling `- traitCollectionDidChange:`). Plus, you can save current position as a JSON String by `[UIWebView -currentPosition]` and restore by `[UIWebView -restorePosition:]` if needed.

See a real usage inside `Demo` folder.


## Gotcha

`WebViewContentPositioner` may fail if web page contains position-fixed elements on top. It's not intent to be used in a browser but EPUB reader like project.
